            The giant siphonophore, is an invertebrate which lives in the deep sea at 700 m to 
            1,000 m below sea level. It has been found off the coasts around the world, from Iceland in the North 
            Atlantic, to Chile in the South Pacific. Siphonophores are free‐swimming colonial animals composed of asexually produced 
            multicellular zooids. These zooids, which are homologous to solitary animals, are functionally specialized and 
            arranged in complex species‐specific patterns. Zooids cannot survive on their own, relying on symbiosis in order for 
            a complete siphonophore to survive. They are a collection of highly specialized working parts. Some parts catch prey, 
            others digest food, some parts reproduce and others direct the action by swimming. Siphonophores can also be bioluminescent — 
            it creates its own light.
