            <p> The giant panda, classified by its black and white fur, 
                is a bear indigenous to China.  On average, they are
                about 4-5 feet and weight approximately 300
                pounds.  Pandas are often found in forests
                where they feed on bamboo, which makes up almost their entire diet.
                They can eat up to 30lb of bamboo daily 
                Pandas were labeled as an endangered species for a long time, but 
                they were recently updated to "vulnerable" species.
