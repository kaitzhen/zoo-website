            Cheetahs are carnivores who chase down their prey at high speeds. Their bodies are uniquely adapted to help them reach high speeds when running. Cheetahs are famous for their black covered coats. Cheetahs have excellent eyesight which helps them find prey during the day, and their spots make it hard to see in the tall, dry grass. They are also known as one of the â€œbig cats, next to tigers and lions.
