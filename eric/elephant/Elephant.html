        Elephants are the world's largest land mammals with an average height of 3m and 6 tonnes. You can usually tell the two species of elephant based on their ears, the african elephants have much larger ears, and their trunks are like two fingers. The elephant's tusks are actually teeth and it helps with feeding and defense when fighting. Elephants are known to have very thick skin, up to 2.5cm thick, and the folds and wrinkles in their skin help retain water.
