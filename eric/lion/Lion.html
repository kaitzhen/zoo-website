            Lions are carnivores who hunt in packs. They are the second largest cats in the world, slightly smaller than the tiger. Female lions are the main hunters, and are smaller and more agile than the males. They would hunt in packs fanning out into a semicircle. Lions usually hunt at night  time, and they can steal kills from other carnivores.
