        Zebras are herbivores who are closely related to horses and donkeys. Zebras have white white stripes next to brown stripes, and they have dark skin under their coats. The stripes of the zebra makes them appear unattractive to small predators, and work as a natural sunscreen. Their stripes are also unique where no two zebras have the same pattern of stripes. Zebras live in groups led by a stallion.
