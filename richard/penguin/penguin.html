      <p1 style = "font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 2em;"> Magellanic Penguins live around the areas of southern Chile, Argentina, and the Falklands. You can identify them from their
	black breast band, narrower white eyebrow, and a big pink patch at the base of its bill. Like all penguins they are flightless birds that hunt aquatically, hunting for cuttlefish, squid, krill, and other crustaceans. They currently 
face threats from climate change and oil spills. Aside from man-made threats mentioned before, they face natural threats through stronger predators such as sea lions, giant petrels, and leopard seals which would prey on their young.</p>
