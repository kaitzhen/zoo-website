      <p1 style = "font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 2em;"> The peregine falcon can be found all across North America, while subspecies can be found in many parts of the world. They all inhabit the same type of environments which tend ot be
		along mountain ranges, river valleys, coastlines, and due to the creation of skyscrapers they can even be found with cities with high rises. They spend a lot of their nonbreeding times in southern North America around Mexico. 
		They are in teh raptor family of birds, which consist of birds that have Talons and a sharp curved beak. However, they are the smallest within the group, as most falcons tend to be small. Peregeine falcons are in fact one of the 
		fastest animals in the world, reaching up to speeds of 200 miles an hour when hunting through its diving technique. They tend to hunt medium sized birds but are not opposed to hunting the occasional small mammal. </p>
