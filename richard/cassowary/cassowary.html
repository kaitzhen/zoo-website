      <p1 style = "font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 2em;"> Cassowary are another bird that are flightless, and native to the tropical forests of New Guinea, Aru Islands, and northern Australia.
	They feed mainly on fruit, but are in fact omnivorous. Despite being wary of humans they have the ability and have been shown to seriously injure some people and pets sometimes even fatally.
Which brought forth their title as "the world's most dangerous bird". They can be indentified through the crest on their head and their brightly colored necks, which are usually blue with a hint 
of red or orange mixed in. They are shy birds who tend to live in isolation unless they are breeding, however that is okay given that they have no natural predators in their habitat aside from humans.</p>
